# DEH 64000

DEH 64000 is a "programmer's [Dehacked](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Dehacked)".
It provides a Python API for generating Dehacked64 patches that also makes the
standard contents of the tables that Dehacked64 modifies available to the user.

DEH 64000 uses Doom64's internal variable and type names so that if you've ever
experimented with the Doom64 source code things should seem familiar.  If you
ever wanted to be able to just hack around with Doom64's internal tables and
automatically generate a Dehacked patch of your changes then you'll like DEH
64000.

See the DOOM64EX-Plus GitHub repository for examples and usages of DeHackEd64.
